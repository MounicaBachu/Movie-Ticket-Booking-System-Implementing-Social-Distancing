# Database-design-for-movie-booking-with-social-distancing

Constructed a system for E-ticketing which allows customers to browse movies and book seats while adhering to social distancing protocols to reduce the spread of covid virus during the ongoing pandemic

The purpose of Movie ticket booking system with social distancing is to enhance the existing movie ticket booking system with the guidelines that the government has requested the public to follow in order to reduce the spread of the Covid 19. To achieve this, additional modules are added to the existing system wherein the seats will be automatically blocked/updated based on the booking to ensure social distancing is followed by the customers inside the theatre. Also, in order to monitor the sanitization process and checks from the management side, another module is added to the existing, to ensure, the multiplex is following the protocols to prevent the spread of the disease.
